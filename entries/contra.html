    >Arnold Schwarzenegger</span
  >. Known as <em>Gryzor</em> and/or <em>Probotector</em> in the PAL Region,
  <em>Contra</em> is notable for its gameplay featuring a mixed format of
  standard L→R scrolling alternating with pseudo-3D view in which the player
  proceeds "forward" into the depth of the screen<sup>1</sup>. The game
  culminates in the capricious and unexplained morphing of opposing forces into
  an alien army. In <em>Contra's</em> original arcade version (released 1987),
  players captured in this ultimate level were forced to watch a graphic digital
  dismembering sequence lasting in excess of 17 seconds<strong

  Emergent Hyper-structural Portal Functionality AKA EHSPF (of which
  <span class="wiki-link" onclick="wikiOpen('vpd')">VPD</span>'s are a subset)
  refers to various permutations of functional portals offering veiled or
  shielded glimpses of or contact with the Hidden World AKA the contents of the
  <a href="">Black Box</a> by articulating a poignant and enveloping alternate
  reality. Most often EHSPF is used in reference to digital alternate reality
  platforms (<a href="">VPN</a>'s) containing a palpable aesthetic of
  loneliness, desolation, and longing. The concept emerged as a way to parse the
  emotional and psychological effects of the MetroidVania<sup>1</sup> series of
  games originally associated with the Nintendo Entertainment System (<a href=""
    >NES</a
  >). Primarily centering on <a href="">Metroid</a>,
  <a href="">The Legend of Zelda, </a>and a number of titles from
  <a href="">Konami</a> and, to a lesser extent, Capcom, the series was
  characterized by the insinuation of world beyond view via scrolling - elements
  that pre-exist (and post-exist) engagement. Thus, the player itself controls
  the scrolling, the view of the game orients a limitless reality around
  <em>self</em>. This conjuring or insinuation of the non-temporal non-spatial
  aspects of <a href="">cyberspace</a> led to direct engagement with
  apeirophobia, or fear/fascination with infinity as it pertains to the
  generation of so-called existential (and thus poignant) emotions. These
  emotions result in the digital reality taking on the properties of a
  simulacrum. Extreme examples of this technique include various "infinite loop"
  traps from the EHSPF series including, but not limited to, the
  <a href="">Lost Woods</a> in <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, the
  <a href="">Hidden Level</a> in <em>Solomon's Key</em>, Level 7-4 in Super
  Mario Bros. and, to a certain extent, the <a href="">Ladder Scene</a> in
  <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>. Also vital in the parsing of EHSPF
  functionality is gameplay based on non-linear, self determination and
  cybernetic self-advancement via the acquisition of skills and weapons and need
  to backtrack. The practice of reality morphing/glitches<sup>3</sup> (whether
  intentional or not) as it relates to <a href="">Brecht</a>'s
  <em>Verfremdungseffekt </em>or "distancing effect" also serves to amplify
  emotional effects of the EHSPF series. By reinforcing the digital artifice
  inherent to such environments, players are made aware that they are inhabiting
  a parallel world. Over time, EHSPF terminology has come to be applied to the
  non-digital realm. City streetlights in rain, outdated car interiors, certain
  cloud formations, the creation and collective acceptance of narrative myth,
  <a href="">ornithological</a> bird behaviours<sup>1</sup> - these non-digital
  concepts and occurrences have been cited as carrying with ESHPF properties.
  Additionally, portal functionality can be accessed internally via extended
  meditation, psychosis, and/or psychedelic/<a href="">narcotic</a>
  drugs. Hyper-structurality here refers to the emergence of portal
  functionality from larger systems of interlocking
  <a href="">cybernetic</a> alternate reality generators with common practices,
  phenomenological parameters, and general aesthetic sense.

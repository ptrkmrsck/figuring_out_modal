  Japanese tech conglomerate that, along with Capcom and others, was central to
  the emergent hyper-structural portal functionality (<span

    >EHSPF</span
  >) of oft Alien-oriented 8-bit interfaces for the Nintendo Entertainment
  System (<span class="wiki-link" onclick="wikiOpen('nes')">NES</span>). Base
  structure includes the titles

  (Arcade only), and, to a certain extent, <em>Castlevania</em> and
  <em>Trojan</em>. En masse this subset of games was thought to function as a
  virtual portal between realities (<a href="#VPD">VPD</a>), with the game's
  creators shielded behind a translucent yet impenetrable veil, perhaps made of
  mirrored glass somehow presenting itself as continually cascading liquid metal
  (re: <Esper>Terminator 2: Judgement Day </Esper>starring
  <a href="#Arnold-Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>). Through the 90's
  and into the 00's, Konami came to be defined by the exploits of Hideo Kojima,
  mastermind of the
  <em><a href="#Metal-Gear-Solid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> series.

  <br />
  Japanese tech conglomerate that, along with Capcom and others, was central to
  the emergent hyper-structural portal functionality (<span

    data-wiki="ehspf"
    >EHSPF</span
  >) of oft Alien-oriented 8-bit interfaces for the Nintendo Entertainment
  System (<span class="wiki-link" data-wiki="nes">NES</span>). Base structure
  includes the titles

  (Arcade only), and, to a certain extent, <em>Castlevania</em> and
  <em>Trojan</em>. En masse this subset of games was thought to function as a
  virtual portal between realities (<span class="wiki-link" data-wiki="vpd"
    >VPD</span
  >), with the game's creators shielded behind a translucent yet impenetrable
  veil, perhaps made of mirrored glass somehow presenting itself as continually
  cascading liquid metal (re:

  exploits of Hideo Kojima, mastermind of the
  <em><a href="#Metal-Gear-Solid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> series.
